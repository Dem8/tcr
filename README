A test case reducer for mutated files

* python 2.7+ required
* sbutils from Cydia to use TCR on iOS
* a web server to serve the temp file

This is a little tool to find the magic offset. It comes ready to iOS, but can be easily fixed to work in any context with minor changes.

Usage example:

./tcr.py MobileSafari original.mov mutated.mov mediaserverd 6

Enjoy!
